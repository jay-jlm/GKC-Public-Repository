Very useful to create a simple broken version of a gameObject using only what is in GKC SliceSystem + MeshSaver (https://github.com/pharan/Unity-MeshSaver) as an alternative, of course using rayfire or destroyIt would be better.

In short the steps I use are as follows:
========================================
1. Download and install so that later we can save sliced ​​mesh at runtime as an asset.

2. Add "Surface To Slice" Component to the game object that you want to make a broken version of.

3. Start Play and Slice the gameobject as desired, using the melee slice system, or it could also use the slicer of the ezy slice.

4. Pause, and Save all the active "..._Hull" gameObjects in the Hierarchy by selecting all and saving each one by accessing "Save Mesh.." in the Mesh Filter component.

5. create broken version gameObject with sliced ​​mesh that was saved earlier and create a prefab.
   reference : Game Kit Controller>Prefabs>Others>Meshes>brokenCrate Prefab

6. Assign the broken prefab to the crate component in gameObject.
   reference : Game Kit Controller>Prefabs>PickUps>Object To Drop Pickups>Crates>Crate Prefab

And this is an example of the result:
